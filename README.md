chicken-consumption
===================

problem set 5

1. Write a story about econometrics. But, let’s not get overly dramatic with this story. No stories
about sleepless nights or anxiety attacks. Write a story about the course to date (through inference)
for the general linear model (GLM). Think about how we started, with a quest to estimate a model.
We chose to use OLS because it had a very attractive feature. But, then we felt unfulfilled and
wanted more in our econometric life. So, … (5 pts.)
You get the idea. Cover all the key points and write a story that your colleagues will want to read.
You can add some equations to illustrate points, but this is a story that you could tell your
colleagues and they will totally understand what we’ve done and why we’ve been doing what we’ve
been doing since January 21. And when they do read your story, they’ll be happily looking forward
to the exam on March 13. (They’ll also look forward to your sequel: “And Then the Problems
Began.” Due out in late April!)
2. Theory suggests the following general linear specification of demand for chicken in the U.S.:
t 0 1 t 2 t 3 t 4 t t qchik     pchik   pbeef   ppork   dinc  u ;
where: qchikt is per capita consumption of chicken in year t in pounds;
pchikt is the price of chicken in year t (cents per pound);
pbeeft is the price of beef in year t (cents per pound);
pporkt is the price of pork in year t (cents per pound); and
dinct is per capita disposable income in year t ($).
a. Estimate the linear model above. Interpret the parameter estimates. What does each estimate
mean? (1 pt.)
b. Calculate all 4 price and income elasticities at the means of the data. Interpret each. Do they
satisfy the homogeneity restriction that we said was theoretically appropriate? (1 pt.)
c. Create relative prices and income using pporkt as the “numéraire commodity.” Then,
estimate the model using relative prices: (1 pt.)
t 0 1 t 2 t 4 t t qchik     rpchik   rpbeef   rdinc  u
where: qchikt is per capita consumption of chicken in year t in pounds;
rpchikt is the relative price of chicken in year t;
rpbeeft is the relative price of beef in year t; and
rdinct is relative per capita disposable income in year t.
d. Calculate all 4 price and income elasticities. Do the elasticities satisfy the homogeneity
constraint? (Hint: Derive expressions for the elasticities in terms of the population
parameters and original variables. Remember, ppork is in every variable so you can find the
partial derivative with respect to ppork. Compare these expressions.) (2 pts
